transcript=\"00:00:02\\nhi I'm Roger Frampton and I'm a movement\\n00:00:05\\ncoach from London and I'm author of the\\n00:00:07\\nbook the flexible body so this position\\n00:00:10\\nis the squat\\n00:00:11\\nmost people when I talk about the squat\\n00:00:13\\nthinking when I'm forming up and down\\n00:00:14\\nexercise it works your legs and bar\\n00:00:16\\nwell the squat is actually a position\\n00:00:19\\nthat we're designed to defecate in every\\n00:00:22\\nkid sits and rests in this position and\\n00:00:25\\nif we look at Western people I think\\n00:00:28\\nmost people end up sitting up on their\\n00:00:31\\ntoes more in this position while I'm\\n00:00:33\\nadvising is that you get this position\\n00:00:35\\nback not for an exercise necessarily not\\n00:00:38\\nbecause of fitness or to be fitter but\\n00:00:40\\njust because you're designed to do it\\n00:00:43\\nthis here is just the human resting\\n00:00:45\\nposition so when I run classes people\\n00:00:48\\nalways talk about the squat how they\\n00:00:50\\ncan't quite get their heel down on the\\n00:00:51\\nfloor now the reason for that is because\\n00:00:53\\nsince about the age of four years old\\n00:00:55\\nyou've been wearing shoes we are an\\n00:00:58\\nanimal\\nwe're designed to walk around on bare\\n00:01:00\\nfeet and the reason that we'll lose our\\n00:01:02\\nsquat mobility is simply because we come\\n00:01:05\\nto become tight in our ankles and\\n00:01:07\\ntherefore you can't get all the way down\\n00:01:09\\nto the bottom now all you need to do is\\n00:01:11\\n00:01:12\\nif you put your heels on a yoga block or\\n00:01:14\\na book you're in that position rather\\n00:01:16\\nthan that position that will take away\\n00:01:19\\nyour ankle mobility and allow you to get\\n00:01:21\\nall the way down now you can use a yoga\\n00:01:23\\nblock or a book or two or three of them\\n00:01:24\\nif you're a girl squatting in heels it's\\n00:01:27\\nso much easier and squatting flat on the\\n00:01:29\\nfloor so what you do is you start on\\n00:01:31\\nwhatever angle you're comfortable in and\\n00:01:33\\nyou work your way down to becoming flat\\n00:01:36\\non the floor so really a squat is just a\\n00:01:39\\ntest of your ankles if you've got good\\n00:01:42\\nankles you're great at squatting and if\\n00:01:45\\nyour ankles have become tight then squat\\n00:01:47\\nis really difficult and hard but like\\n00:01:49\\nevery other muscle and joint in the body\\n00:01:51\\nis trainable and you've got time to get\\n00:01:54\\nit back if you do something for 10\\n00:01:56\\nminutes every day kind of like brushing\\n00:01:58\\nyour teeth it gets into a habit and you\\n00:02:01\\ngo you get up you brush your teeth go to\\n00:02:02\\nveggie brush your teeth so by doing 10\\n00:02:05\\nminutes every day\\n00:02:06\\nyou'll get into the habit by playing\\n00:02:08\\nusing just that short of a short amount\\n00:02:10\\nof time you can really focus on how your\\n00:02:12\\nbody's anemic\\n00:02:13\\nnow some of the exercises that I\\n00:02:15\\nrecommend that you do within those 10\\n00:02:16\\nminutes first one is the squat sitting\\n00:02:20\\nin a squat not bobbing up and down just\\n00:02:22\\nbeing able to function to sit in the\\n00:02:24\\nsquat something again is innate to us as\\n00:02:27\\nhuman beings and something that you are\\n00:02:28\\nable to do as a child so spend 10\\n00:02:31\\nminutes every day getting your squat\\n00:02:34\\nback\\n00:02:37\\n[Music]\\n00:02:51\")]}}\n",

transcript=\"00:00:02\\nhi I'm Roger Frampton and I'm a movement\\n00:00:05\\ncoach from London and I'm author of the\\n00:00:07\\nbook the flexible body so this position\\n00:00:10\\nis the squat\\n00:00:11\\nmost people when I talk about the squat\\n00:00:13\\nthinking when I'm forming up and down\\n00:00:14\\nexercise it works your legs and bar\\n00:00:16\\nwell the squat is actually a position\\n00:00:19\\nthat we're designed to defecate in every\\n00:00:22\\nkid sits and rests in this position and\\n00:00:25\\nif we look at Western people I think\\n00:00:28\\nmost people end up sitting up on their\\n00:00:31\\ntoes more in this position while I'm\\n00:00:33\\nadvising is that you get this position\\n00:00:35\\nback not for an exercise necessarily not\\n00:00:38\\nbecause of fitness or to be fitter but\\n00:00:40\\njust because you're designed to do it\\n00:00:43\\nthis here is just the human resting\\n00:00:45\\nposition so when I run classes people\\n00:00:48\\nalways talk about the squat how they\\n00:00:50\\ncan't quite get their heel down on the\\n00:00:51\\nfloor now the reason for that is because\\n00:00:53\\nsince about the age of four years old\\n00:00:55\\nyou've been wearing shoes we are an\\n00:00:58\\nanimal\\nwe're designed to walk around on bare\\n00:01:00\\nfeet and the reason that we'll lose our\\n00:01:02\\nsquat mobility is simply because we come\\n00:01:05\\nto become tight in our ankles and\\n00:01:07\\ntherefore you can't get all the way down\\n00:01:09\\nto the bottom now all you need to do is\\n00:01:11\\n00:01:12\\nif you put your heels on a yoga block or\\n00:01:14\\na book you're in that position rather\\n00:01:16\\nthan that position that will take away\\n00:01:19\\nyour ankle mobility and allow you to get\\n00:01:21\\nall the way down now you can use a yoga\\n00:01:23\\nblock or a book or two or three of them\\n00:01:24\\nif you're a girl squatting in heels it's\\n00:01:27\\nso much easier and squatting flat on the\\n00:01:29\\nfloor so what you do is you start on\\n00:01:31\\nwhatever angle you're comfortable in and\\n00:01:33\\nyou work your way down to becoming flat\\n00:01:36\\non the floor so really a squat is just a\\n00:01:39\\ntest of your ankles if you've got good\\n00:01:42\\nankles you're great at squatting and if\\n00:01:45\\nyour ankles have become tight then squat\\n00:01:47\\nis really difficult and hard but like\\n00:01:49\\nevery other muscle and joint in the body\\n00:01:51\\nis trainable and you've got time to get\\n00:01:54\\nit back if you do something for 10\\n00:01:56\\nminutes every day kind of like brushing\\n00:01:58\\nyour teeth it gets into a habit and you\\n00:02:01\\ngo you get up you brush your teeth go to\\n00:02:02\\nveggie brush your teeth so by doing 10\\n00:02:05\\nminutes every day\\n00:02:06\\nyou'll get into the habit by playing\\n00:02:08\\nusing just that short of a short amount\\n00:02:10\\nof time you can really focus on how your\\n00:02:12\\nbody's anemic\\n00:02:13\\nnow some of the exercises that I\\n00:02:15\\nrecommend that you do within those 10\\n00:02:16\\nminutes first one is the squat sitting\\n00:02:20\\nin a squat not bobbing up and down just\\n00:02:22\\nbeing able to function to sit in the\\n00:02:24\\nsquat something again is innate to us as\\n00:02:27\\nhuman beings and something that you are\\n00:02:28\\nable to do as a child so spend 10\\n00:02:31\\nminutes every day getting your
